Steps to follow:

***IMPORTANT: Change the API key of OpenWeatherApp to your API Key  of OpenWeatherApp in html and css file.

Run html file on your local host and then...
1. Enter City Name.
2. Enter how many hours later forcast user wants to see the weather and click on the button.
3. It'll show the Country, City name, it's temperature, Maximum-Minimum Temperature, weather type & WindSpeed in web app.
4. Weather Icon is being shown according to weather condition at that time.
5. If user click on the "Temperature" or "speed", it's units changes from °C to °F and from m/s to mph respectively.

I've added the css, html and js file includin Icons and text format in the folder.


I've added the css file in script of html.
Reason: I've done developing for the very first time, so there were little questions in my mind like
taking input from html file and giving it to css file, and there wasted a lot of my time, so I've merged these
two files in script of html. Anyways, I really enjoyed my past 2 days learning new and new things, and I hope
that you may also approcoate my work.
